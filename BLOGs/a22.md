# Introduction 
 
##  A2.2 Learning Activity
 
- System architecture documentation based on the 4 + 1 model
 
 
###  Development
 
1. Draw the diagrams for each of the views established in the 4 + 1 architecture model.
 
   - [x] View of the scenarios: Diagram of user cases

    - [x] Logical view: Class diagram

    - [x] Process view: Sequence diagram

    - [x] Developer view: Component diagram
 
    - [x] Physical view: Distribution diagram ![phisicsview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Carlos-Gallardoo/AnalisisAvanzadoDeSoftware/8b9784622956e4617f4069b0338b39833b088fee/img/4%2B1%20view%20physical.svg)
 
1. Each diagram must contain at least 3 elements within its representation.
 
 
    - [x] Use cases (Include at least 5 elements of the diagram)

2. Indicate by means of annotations the own technologies that will be used, relying on images or illustrations that represent them.
 
 
 
## Conclusions
 
Carlos Gallardo
The software architecture allows us to understand how the elements of the system will interact with each other. In other words, it allows us to identify the nature of the software communication. One of the biggest steps in this stage is identifying the tools, languages, devices, etc. that will be used within the development of the project. The most challenging part of this stage is identifying the criteria for developing the project.

This activity was very interesting because we were able to integrate different diagrams that we have already been working on during the project repeatedly, there were some diagrams a little complex to perform because in the documentation to make them came an example more applied to a project with physical components and not for a software one, however this helped us to see how this could be applied to our project.
In the end all these diagrams help us to understand in depth the project to be developed and thus to be able to take it to code.

In this activity, the part that had doubts was in the architectural views, thanks to the help of my team, we were able to solve it. I think that the diagrams that we have made over time are very useful for the development of our project in the same way as we will plan it and with what bases for the creation of it, we think about the way in which we were going to create it and have it with the expectations that you want to achieve.
