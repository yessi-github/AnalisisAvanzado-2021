## Introduction

## :trophy: A3.3 Learning Activity

Software architecture design using C4 model

### :blue_book: Instructions

- Based on research and the document provided by the assessor, perform the project documentation using the scrum framework for the case study.
- The activity should be done using a platform such as **Notion**, or **Confluence**, and should be submitted in PDF style, naming it with the nomenclature **A3.3_ActivityName_StudentName.pdf.**.
- Your repository, in addition to having a **readme**.md file in its root directory, with information such as student data, work team, subject, career, advisor data, and even logo or images, must have a contents section or index.

### :pencil2: Development

1. Draw up the following diagrams for the case study:
   
   - [x] 1. Context diagram.
   - [x] 2. Container diagram.
   - [x] 3. Component diagram.
   - [x] 4. Class diagram.

## :bulb: Conclusions

I consider that SCRUM is a framework that is quite useful since it leads you to have good practices when developing software. During this activity I felt quite comfortable doing it since most of the techniques mentioned are very attached to common sense, that is, they are things that you can easily apply and it made us see from another perspective the way in which we make decisions as a team. Before, what we did was that the person we considered the strongest in the programming area was the one who made the decisions about how complicated a task was, so I liked the idea of ​​using voting.

In this activity we use the Confluence platform again to make the diagrams we use draw io based on the previous diagrams that we had made context, containers, components, class but here we will incorporate the software architecture through the C4 model, it was not difficult to implement this topic to The diagrams that we had already made were very helpful since I did not know these types of diagrams for our research.
