Project documentation using the Scrum framework for the planning and estimation phase.

### :blue_book: Instrucciones

- Based on an investigation and on the document provided by the advisor, carry out the project documentation using the scrum framework for the case study.
- The activity must be carried out using a platform such as **Notion**, or **Confluence**, and it must be sent in PDF style, naming it with the nomenclature **A3.4_NombredelaActivity_NombreAlumno.pdf.**
- Your repository in addition to having a **readme**. Md file in your root directory, with information such as student data, work team, subject, career, advisor data, and even logo or images, it must have a section of contents or index.
  
## :pencil2: Developing

1. Join your work team and start preparing what is requested below:
   - [x] 1.1 Identify the tasks for each user story.
   - [x] 1.2 Estimate the tasks using a digital tool.
   - [x] 1.3 Create the Sprint backlog with the tasks estimated in hours.
   - [x] 1.4 Build your gantt chart.
   - [x] 1.5 Identify dependencies of each task and relate it to the activity it depends on.
   - [x] 1.6 Prepare the Burn down chart of the sprint.

2. Present this information using visual and graphical tools within the sprint planning meeting.

3. Place a section with evidence that shows that they met to develop the activity as a team.

## Conclusions

 **Carlos Gallardo** 

At this point we begin to work with what our project sprints are (which are the deliveries that we are going to be making to the customer).
The most challenging part of this activity is to have the gantt chart that fits well with the days the sprint is expected to last, in addition to the fact that it has to consider what tasks can be carried out at the same time and it has to avoid leaving empty spaces of work. It is also important to consider that the tasks cannot be greater than 1 day of work. 

 **Yessica Orihuela**

This activity was a little more complicated than the others since the user stories were divided into small tasks, what was most complicated for us was the gantt diagram since the tasks must be well divided between the people who develop and within the scheduled delivery date. I consider that the scheduling of the schedule is very important in a software project since it must be contemplated when the project is going to be completed.

 **Merari Cortes**
In this activity we use the example that the teacher gave us to create the blacklog for the sprint, here we choose the epics of the last activity to evaluate them and put them from lowest to highest the hours in which they would work in the same way we use the PlanITpoker platform to To do that part, everything we discussed in our meet sections in this activity we had problems when putting the blacklog because it was in Excel and we wanted to put it in the Confluence platform but when converting it to md it did not look nice so we opted to put it this way way in this activity I was able to realize the procedures that must be done to elaborate


 **María Sanabria**

As part of the software implementation, using PlanitPoker resulta very useful for any sprint made of the project. In general, I think making this activity had no important differences comparing to the previous one. At least, once I step into a project like this in my profesional área, I'll have a better idea of what's going to be done. One thing I really learnt about the activity is that communication is fundamental, or at least each of the teamwork members make sure the fully understand the time and the efforts for each method to be implemented.
