# A1.1 Learning activity
Requirements modeling through UML diagrams

----
1. Based on each of the user and system requirements established above for the
case study, write the requested modeling diagrams:



- A diagram containing the relationships between the different use cases, only for the scenario in which
the user interacts with the system making use of the main or central functions according to each case study. (Include at least 5 elements of the diagram)

- The sequence diagram that explains the communication between the different GUIs for the use cases of the previous point, considering that the user has already successfully entered the system. (Include as minimum 5 elements of the diagram)

- The class diagrams for the objects to be instantiated, for the aforementioned points.
(Include at least 5 elements of the diagram)

- A package diagram containing the component diagrams and the relationships between the database data, user interfaces, controllers or intermediate layers - middleware. (Include at least 3
diagram elements)

- Distribution diagrams representing the physical structure of the system as can infrastructure
physical, networks, storage and web servers, firewall, mobile devices or any other resource
physical that will be part of the system. (Include at least 3 elements of the diagram)

## Conclusions 
### **Merari Cortes**
In this activity I investigated how to make the diagrams since in some I had doubts, it was interesting to know that several diagrams are needed to check the relationships that our project is going to have.
It was easier in the first diagrams but already in the last ones it was a bit complicated.
### **Carlos Gallardo**
UML diagrams bring us one step closer to the objective we want to achieve to start developing our project, already having all the guidelines, tools and references necessary to do so. It is important that the entire team understands the diagrams in the same way and that they are clear and concise so that there is no confusion in the future. The biggest challenge in this phase is to identify the most important parts of the project and focus on them to represent them in a clear way, after that focus on the less important parts.
### **Yessica Orihuela**
In this activity, the easiest part was undoubtedly to make the first diagrams of the activities, which were the ones we have been working on lately in class, and the distribution diagram, since it's not so easy to capture the ideas in them.
I consider that the diagrams are very useful in all the stages of the development of a project since we can go back to them in case we have doubts during the development of the project.
 
### **Maria Jazmin Sanabria**
A few years ago I used to work with UML diagrams which I consider useful yet boring to make, especially the case of use and sequence diagrams. As a program developer, simulating how a system could work is fundamental, thus brainstorming through imagination results pretty practical. Another thing Iâ€™d account for is that diagrams should always be understandable for customers, rather than the teamwork itself.
