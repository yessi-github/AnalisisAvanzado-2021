| Document purpose|
| --- |
| This document defines the general description, objectives and participants of the project. It is mainly related to the authorization of the start of the project. It also provides a description of the current situation, high-level requirements, success criteria, risks and opportunities.|
 
| Purpose/Justification|
| --- |
| “The vid of knowledge” is a company that offers technology tools based on knowledge management and preservation, however due to the high competitiveness of the market and the current and changing conditions, through a market study on other similar platforms, it has been determined the convenience of providing an application related to the "knowledge search" through an online platform.|
 
| Brief project description|
| --- |
| Implement an online platform based on the search of knowledge, allowing access to an organized topics catalog, as well as the creation of a new topic so it can be registered in the platform, allowing it to be rated by different users.|
 
| Preliminary scope of the project|
| --- |
| The following elements **are** contemplated within the Initial Scope of the Project:                                 
 1.-  Analysis of functional requirements 
 2.- Platform interface design 
 3.- Topic registration functionality 
 4.- Topic evaluation functionality 
 5.- Topic search functionality 
 6.-Start-up of the platform hosted in the cloud. 
 The following elements **are not** contemplated within the Initial Scope of the   
 1.- The development of CRUD or user registration to the platform 
 2.- Hiring of hosting services 
 3.- Drafting of all the topics of the platform|
 
| Expected project results/Benefits|
| --- |
| The benefits that are foreseen with this project is that as the platform begins to be used by users and it can be enriched with topics, searches can be carried out as well as being able to give evaluations to each topic and be able to present data analytics to the company so that the performance of the platform can be observed.|
 
| High-level project requirements||
| --- | --- |
| **Requirement**|**Success criteria**|
| To offer users a platform that is available at all times, that is easy to use and attractive, as well as guaranteeing the security of the information that is registered there. |The service object of this act will be terminated once the platform is considered secure and the security of the user's information is guaranteed.
|When a user writes a topic, they will be offered a catalog with related and existing topics. | This requirement is considered fulfilled once the user is allowed to view a considerable amount of topics and can enrich their knowledge when searching for topics using keywords of interest. |
|Allow published topics to also attach photos, videos or presentations with a maximum size and duration limit. | This requirement will be terminated once users add new topics to the platform and these can be made public to the rest of the users.|
|Offer the user the power to consult the topics that have been registered as well as the power to download the referenced documents locally. | This requirement will be terminated once the users can carry out specialized searches and evaluate them and they can be available for the rest of the users.|
|Offer data analytics on the topics that are more concurrent, the topics to users who do not find the topic that shows a similar topic, using the recommendations or solutions made by the system itself. |This stage is considered completed when the company is able to access the graphs and statistics about the performance of the platform over the next 3 months of implementation.

## Conclusions

### Yessica Orihuela
In this practice of the constitutive act of the project,the easiest things to do were the objectives, the justification because if you know well the project and its scope and you know well what you want to achieve that is not too complicated.
One of the things a little more complicated was the costs since I have never sold a software or a project that is worked in team since it is required to pay the salary of several people, this is complicated to establish since I do not have experience in that, however these practices serve to think a little about that and to be taking experience.

### Carlos Gallardo
The constitutive act is an extremely important document that provides both the client and the developers with a document detailing all the elements that will make up the project (so that there are no doubts when it starts being developed). The biggest challenge with the act is that both the client and their counterpart are satisfied.

### Merari Cortes
In this practice I realized the steps that are carried out to carry out a project for a company, all the requirements that we must take into account, a clear purpose of the project as well as an estimate of the cost of the project, this was not so complex. Practice if not that I had to inform myself a price range that a project like this needs to get up.

### Jazmin Sanabria
Making a Software project is neither fast nor simple, since a large variety of things should be taken into account such as the people directly involved, the limitations and the projections over the established goals. All of these processes have something in common: clarifying every point so there wouldn’t be space for any doubts or misunderstandings. I think a fundamental part of a consolidation document is not just doing things right, but knowing exactly where the project is ending and how it is going to make it through. After all, no matter how well an application is well-coded, if it doesn’t reflect the customer needings, the efforts and time will be worthless.
