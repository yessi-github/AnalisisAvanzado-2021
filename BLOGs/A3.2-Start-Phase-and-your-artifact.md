## Conclusions
 
 **Carlos Gallardo**   

 The scrum board is a useful tool to be able to list the epics and user stories that will help us to carry out the sprints (which will be the deliveries periodically). One of the main functions of this is to separate them in order of priority, complexity and give the guidelines of the approximate time that will be taken to perform each point within the scrum board (everything will depend on the capabilities of the work team) one of the most challenging part of the activity is organizing the team to perform a scrum poker that will help us understand the knowledge and capabilities of the team. It is important that everyone is clear about what is going to be done at each point of the scrum board and that an intermediate point of scoring is reached for each activity. If any point is not clear enough, it means that it must be modified

 
**Yessica Orihuela**  

I consider that SCRUM is a framework that is quite useful since it leads you to have good practices when developing software. During this activity I felt quite comfortable doing it since most of the techniques mentioned are very attached to common sense, that is, they are things that you can easily apply and it made us see from another perspective the way in which we make decisions as a team. Before, what we did was that the person we considered the strongest in the programming area was the one who made the decisions about how complicated a task was, so I liked the idea of ​​using voting.

 
**Merari Cortes**

In this activity we again use the Conluence platform, which I have already become more familiar with that platform as well as with two others that we used, one was PlanitPoker to see voting about User stories and the other application was Trello in which we planned our meetings. As a team to organize ourselves, I realized that several tools are needed for planning and to carry out this activity.
 
**María Sanabria**  

Adapting to a different work system is always kind of difficult, in my opinion. At the beginning of the activity I was not involved with concepts such as epics and histories, in the SCRUM context. But once I got in practice I found it pretty useful for software development. I think this will be an excellent tool when I get my degree in informatics, or at least, having a basic knowledge about it. Also, Confluence makes the teamwork easier than before since connects each of the Team members, creating better collaboration and ideas.
