# A0.1 Data collection through interview

- Taking as a basis the characteristics referred to in the case study and the design thinking proposal, elaborate context, a list of at least 15 questions directed to the client, such that they can give more detailed information to elaborate the analysis of the requirements on the case study.
- Once the interview indicated in the previous point has been carried out, use any of the techniques that are proposed within the empathize phase of design thinking, and you can even use any other tool, technique or artifact to consolidate the information collected through the client and elaborate your proposal for the business model of the system to be developed.
- Prepare and expose your document, considering doing the dynamics as you would do a job in the field or client site, and present it to the advisor and your classmates.

## Information consolidation 
The method that is going to be used is the What, how, why method. 

| What (what are you doing?)                                      | How (How are you doing it)                                                                               | Why (Why are you doing it)                                                            |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| An easy-to-access platform.                                     | By Using simple design and frameworks that help us work more organized                                   | To generate a friendly platform.                                                      |
| A system that adapts to the company needs                       | Through an API                                                                                           | Use the resources that the company already has                                        |

## Conclusions 

### **Merari Cortes**
In this activity I had problems with the questions and the consolidation was a bit complicated, in the part of the questions I learned that there are ways to relate them to the type of environment and to the person to whom we are going to address the process to collect that information, but it helps us with our case study this phase has left me knowledge and will help me in a professional way. 
### **Carlos Gallardo**
Trying to talk with a client sometimes can be a challenging activity that takes a lot of practice. One of the hardest parts of the activity was trying to understand exactly what the client is expecting for the project to be an attractive option. I learned that you can’t ask any question to a client because sometimes the questing might not be clear enough, or it might be too technical for them. We needed to translate the clients answers into requirements which took us some time. We finally decided to use the What, How, Why method to consolidate all the information that was compiled from the interview.    
### **Yessica Orihuela**
The easiest part of the activity was perhaps to make the context diagram, since it was simply to put together the ideas that we had previously in the previous activity and make it one. 
The most difficult part for me was the consolidation of the information since it is one of the most important parts because you have to analyze very well the information obtained in the interview. I learned how design questions directed to a potential client and how it should be done. Finally, the activity was achieved and the result was a consolidation of information based on the method of: What, How and Why, as we considered that it was a good way to easily explain our use case.

### **Maria Jazmin Sanabria**
Involving the process of formulating questions and creating a consolidation system was sort of hard from me. Not only was it complex and long to develop, but an intuitive analysis of the case study is critically needed, as all of the results of such information will almost predict how the project is moving forward. One thing I've actually learned is, beside the previous point, the way we process the collected data and the decisions we make about it is more important than the collected data itself.
I think, in general, working as a teamwork member is helping me to build solid software project knowledge, which will help me later in my professional career.
